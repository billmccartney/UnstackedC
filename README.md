Stackless Multithreading for C

[UnStacked C](https://www.unstackedc.com) is a stackless multithreading system. It allows programmers to write software in a traditional preemptive multithreaded fashion, but allows the programs to execute in an event driven fashion.

It was initially designed for TinyOS (an RTOS for sensor networks), but it can be run on modern computers and in embedded systems.

## Status
This project has been updated to run on modern systems in 2022. It is based off of graduate work done in 2006-2011 [see Publications for details](https://www.unstackedc.com/publications/).
